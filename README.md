# recsys
 a basic recommender system
 using neural network, more precisely, autoencoders 
 we take input a rating table and then predict the rating
 since at bottleneck only the important features are in existence, we use it to our advantage.
 We predict a output matrix and a matrix that existed at bottleneck and compare their resuts.
